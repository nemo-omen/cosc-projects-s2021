HW 4

COSC 1174

Ch 14 JavaFX Basics

All code should have comments for every method and variable. It may seem obvious to you what you were writing, but when you’re working on a team, it will save a lot of time and questions from your teammates who it may not be so obvious to.

The top of every class you submit should have a block comment containing name, course #, date, assignment name, and anything else significant like partner names for group work.

All programs should be put into a single folder with a readme file explaining how the program should be run. Then zip the folder (7zip is free and simple) and submit the zip file.

Poker #1

For this program, refer to programming exercise 14.3, on page 586 in your textbook. Instead of 3 cards, you should deal a full poker hand of 5. Note: your program should not allow a given card to be dealt twice in the same hand. The image files you need to use should have been downloaded alongside this word file.

For this program, simply submit the java, UML, and readme files in a compressed folder.

#### Textbook exercise instructions:

*14.3 (Display three cards) Write a program that displays three cards randomly selected from a deck of 52, as shown in Figure 14.43c . The card image files are named 1.png, 2.png, . . . , 52.png and stored in the image/card directory. All three cards are distinct and selected randomly. (Hint: You can select random cards by storing the numbers 1–52 to an array list, perform a random shuffle introduced in Section 11.12, , and use the first three numbers in the array list as the file names for the image.)
