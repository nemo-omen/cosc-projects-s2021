## Usage

### Getting Started

To run Minecraft Blocks, you'll need to have a recent Java Runtime Environment and Java Development Kit installed on your machine. If you have both of those you can open the directory you're reading this file from in your favorite Java-capable IDE. Once you have the project loaded into the editor, open `Test.java` and run it however your IDE usually runs Java files.

### In the Test program

The test program is more or less totally linear. Once it starts it's just a series of `yes` or `no` questions. Progress through these questions to interact with the `Sand` class. You can basically decide whether you want to mine some sand. That's it! You can respond with `y`, `n`, `yes` or `no` to each of the questions when prompted. If you respond with something else, the program will politely remind you that it will only accept one of those responses.
